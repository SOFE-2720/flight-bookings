Introduction

A new flight booking website called OTU Flights is looking to start development on their product. To ensure a smooth execution of the production, stakeholders are asked to discuss the needs and requirements before production begins. 


Product vision and scope

OTU Flights is a website that will make booking domestic flights easier and faster. It will have the best flight rates ranging from cheap to first-class. This project will create a basic domestic flight booking system website available to everyone.


How to Run the Website

To run the website, you need to download the flightpage.html code, mainpage.html, style.css, and the Images folder. Put all the files into one location and then you can access the web pages from there.
